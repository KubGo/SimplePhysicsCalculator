## Simple physics calculator

This project is a simple physics calculator app for practicing java
programing and some simple calculations. Time will show how far I'll go 
with this project.

### Features to implement:
- [ ] velocity and acceleration calculator
- [ ] force and torque calculator
- [ ] stress and strain calculator
- [ ] fluid pressure and velocity calculator

All the elements are supposed to be available to the end user in GUI,
but that's something that will be done in the future.
